# SPAT
Semantic-and-Naturalness Preserving Auto Transformation. This tool is a source-to-source transformation tool that can deal with partial code snippets (programs without dependency information). The transformed code will be semantic-equivalent to the original ones, as well as syntax-naturalness-preserving.

We have currently verified it on Windows10.

This project is developed in "Eclipse IDE for RCP and RAP Developers". If you want to play with the code, please use the same IDE. Starting with the "src/spat/RuleSelector.java" will bring you a nice view of the whole project.

We have produced a runnable jar file already in "artifacts". 

To use this tool, simply type the followed command:

```consolo
java -jar SPAT.jar [RuleId] [RootDir] [OutputDir] [PathofJre] \& [PathofotherDependentJar]
```

*[RuleId]* is the transformation rule you want to adopt. 

*[RootDir]* is the root directory path in which you put all your code snippets to be transformed. each ".java'' file is regarded as a code snippet. Each file should contain one Java class. For method-level code snippets, users need to warp each method with a "foo'' class.

*[OutputDir]* is the directory path whre you want to store the transformed code snippets.

*[PathofJre]* is the path of *rt.jar* (usually placed in ".../jre1.x.x\_xxx/lib/''})

*[PathofotherDependentJar]* is optional, one can use it to specify additional dependent libraries.

For example, 
```consolo
java -jar .\artifacts\SPAT.jar 5 .\Benchmarks\9133\Original .\Benchmarks\9133\transformed\_5 C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_221\lib\rt.jar
```
This command will transform all java files under the ".\Benchmarks\9133\Original" path by the transformation rule 5 "ConditionalExp2SingleIF" to the path ".\Benchmarks\9133\\_5". The only dependency is the rt.jar (java runtime).

##### 	16. PrePostFixExpressionDividing
Divide the pre-or-post expression into two seperated expressions.
##### 	17. Case2IfElse
Change the Switch-Case statements into If-Else statements.




## Datasets

##### Educoder

The Educoder code clone dataset. In the "records.txt" file, each record is a triple (file1,file2,label). For example, (file1,file2,-1) means that it is not a clone, otherwise it is a clone.

##### 9133 benchmark

The 9133 benchmark is selected from BCB benchmark, we use the 9133 instances to evaluate the syntax naturalness, applicability, and  speed of each transformation rule.

##### Java Corpus

This dataset is used to train the Neural Probabilistic Language Model (see below).
